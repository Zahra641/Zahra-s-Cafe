      <h2>origin & history of cafe </h2>
      <p>The term “café”, which is widely used to describe a restaurant that primarily serves coffee and snacks, has a rich history that dates back to the 15th century. The origin of the café, or coffee house, can be traced back to modern-day Somalia, Ethiopia, and Yemen, where coffee was already known in the 15th century. It was in Yemen that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to how it is now prepared for drinking. The coffee beans were procured from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries and cultivated in Yemen.</p>
